- Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)
- Price
- Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)
- Number of rooms
- Area
- Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)
- Furnished (Yes/No)
- Open fire (Yes/No)
- Terrace (Yes/No) 
    - If yes: Area
- Garden (Yes/No)
   - If yes: Area
- Surface of the land
- Surface area of the plot of land
- Number of facades
- Swimming pool (Yes/No)
- State of the building (New, to be renovated, ...)
